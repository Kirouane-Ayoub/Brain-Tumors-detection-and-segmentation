# Brain-Tumors detection and segmentation 
Brain tumor detection and segmentation is a computer vision application that involves identifying the presence and location of tumors in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. 
The segmentation process involves outlining and separating the tumor region from the rest of the brain tissue. This technology can assist in the diagnosis and treatment planning for brain cancer patients.
